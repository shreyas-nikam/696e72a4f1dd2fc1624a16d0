I apologize, but no Streamlit application code or description was attached to your request. To generate the codelab, I need the details of the Streamlit application, including its source code, functionalities, and any relevant concepts it demonstrates.

Please provide the Streamlit application code or a comprehensive description of its features, and I will be happy to generate the codelab following all your guidelines.
